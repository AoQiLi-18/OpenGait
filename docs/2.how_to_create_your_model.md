# How to Create Your Own Model
<!-- This section of documentation will be **refined in the future**. For now, you can refer these files: [default config](../config/default.yaml), [baseline config](../config/baseline.yaml), [loss aggregator](../lib/modeling/loss_aggregator.py), [base_model](../lib/modeling/base_model.py), and [baseline model](../lib/modeling/models/baseline.py).

Then, you can write your own model in `lib\modeling\models`, and use it in configuration file. -->
## A new model
If you want to write a new model, you need to write a class inherited from `BaseModel`, e.g, NewModel in newmodel.py:
```python
from ..base_model import BaseModel

class NewModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, cfgs, is_training):
        super().__init__(cfgs, is_training)

    def build_network(self, model_cfg):
        self.Backbone = self.get_backbone(model_cfg)

    def forward(self, inputs):
        return {
            'training_feat': {
                'triplet': {'embeddings': embed_1, 'labels': labs},
                'softmax': {'logits': logits, 'labels': labs}
            },
            'visual_summary': {
                'image/sils': sils.view(n*s, 1, h, w)
            },
            'inference_feat': {
                'embeddings': embed
            }
        }

```
 In your model class, at least you need to implement `build_network()` and `forward()` functions. `build_network()` needs to build the model, it does not need `return value`. `forward()` is used to calculate the feature, the `return value` is fixed in dictionary format

> `training_feat` is for the loss computing
> 
> `visual_summary` is for visualization
> 
> `inference_feat` is for the inference
> `triplet` and `softmax` are the prefix (or name) of the loss function.
> 
> `embeddings`, `logits` and `labels` are the input arguments of the loss function.

More information should be seen in [`BaseModel`](../lib/modeling/base_model.py).

After you finish writing your model, you have two steps left to do:

**Step 1**: Put newnet.py under `lib/modeling/models`.

**Step 2**: Specify the model name in a yaml file:
```yaml
model_cfg:
  model: NewModel
  param1: ...
  param2: ...
  param3: ...
```


## A new loss
If you want to write a new loss, you need to write a class inherited from `lib/modeling/losses`, like this
```python
from .base import BaseLoss

class NewLoss(BaseLoss):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(TripletLoss, self).__init__(*args, **kargs)

    def forward(self, embeddings, labels):
        pass
```
Then, put your loss in `lib/modeling/losses` so that you can use it in configuration file. The input arguments of `forward()` should be the same as the output of `forward()` in the defined model class.
